    "#### 1. Explain the difference between logistic regression and linear regression?\n",
    "Linear Regression is a commonly used supervised Machine Learning algorithm that predicts continuous values. Linear Regression assumes that there is a linear relationship present between dependent and independent variables. In simple words, it finds the best fitting line/plane that describes two or more variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Logistic Regression is another supervised Machine Learning algorithm that helps fundamentally in binary classification (separating discreet values).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the usage of Linear Regression and Logistic Regression algorithm is completely different, mathematically we can observe that with an additional step we can convert Linear Regression into Logistic Regression.\n",

    "***\n",
    "#### 3. What is feature engineering? Give an example.\n",
    "Feature engineering is the process of selecting, manipulating, and transforming raw data into features that can be used in supervised learning. In order to make machine learning work well on new tasks, it might be necessary to design and train better features. As you may know, a “feature” is any measurable input that can be used in a predictive model — it could be the color of an object or the sound of someone’s voice. Feature engineering, in simple terms, is the act of converting raw observations into desired features using statistical or machine learning approaches.\n",

    "#### 4. What is the difference between a regression and a classification problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Think continuous vs. discrete target variables\n",
    "The most significant difference between regression vs classification is that while regression helps predict a continuous quantity, classification predicts discrete class labels. \n",
    "***\n",
    "#### 5. What evaluation approaches would you work to gauge the effectiveness of a machine learning model?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Split the dataset into training and test sets\n",
    "- Use cross-validation techniques to further segment the dataset into composite sets of training and test sets within the data.\n",
    "- Implement a choice selection of performance metrics: here is a fairly comprehensive list. You could use measures such as the F1 score, the accuracy, and the confusion matrix. What’s important here is to demonstrate that you understand the nuances of how a model is measured and how to choose the right performance measures for the right situations.\n",

    "#### 6. How is KNN different from k-means clustering?\n",
    "\n",
    "- K-Nearest Neighbors: supervised classification algorithm, so you need labeled data you want to classify an unlabeled point into (thus the nearest neighbor part)\n",
    "- K-means: unsupervised clustering algorithm. Need a set of unlabeled points and a threshold and the algorithm will take unlabeled points and gradually learn how to cluster them into groups by computing the mean of the distance between different points.\n",
    "***\n",
    "#### 7. How do you handle missing or corrupted data in a dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "- drop those rows or columns, or decide to replace them with another value.\n",
    "- In Pandas, there are two very useful methods: isnull() and dropna() that will help you find columns of data with missing or corrupted data and drop those values. If you want to fill the invalid values with a placeholder value (for example, 0), you could use the fillna() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "#### 8. How is a decision tree pruned?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduced error pruning is perhaps the simplest version: replace each node. If it doesn’t decrease predictive accuracy, keep it pruned.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "#### 9. A model performs at 99% accuracy. Under what conditions could this metric be entirely misleading?\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you wanted to detect fraud in a massive dataset with a sample of millions, a more accurate model would most likely predict no fraud at all if only a vast minority of cases were fraud. However, this would be useless for a predictive model — a model designed to find fraud that asserted there was no fraud at all! Questions like this help you demonstrate that you understand model accuracy isn’t the be-all and end-all of model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "#### 10. What’s the F1 score? How would you use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is a measure of a model’s performance. It is a weighted average of the precision and recall of a model, with results tending to 1 being the best, and those tending to 0 being the worst. You would use it in classification tests where true negatives don’t matter much.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "#### 11. How would you handle an imbalanced dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "- An imbalanced dataset is when you have, for example, a classification test and 90% of the data is in one class. That leads to problems: an accuracy of 90% can be skewed if you have no predictive power on the other category of data! Here are a few tactics to get over the hump:\n",
    "     - 1- Collect more data to even the imbalances in the dataset.\n",
    "     - 2- Resample the dataset to correct for imbalances.\n",
    "     - 3- Try a different algorithm altogether on your dataset.\n",

    "#### 13. Explain what is overfitting, how you would control for it, and how you can identify whether you have overfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overfitting is finding spurious results that are due to chance and cannot be reproduced by subsequent studies.\n",
    "- reduce risk of overfitting by:\n",
    "- Keep the model simpler: reduce variance by taking into account fewer variables and parameters, thereby removing some of the noise in the training data.\n",
    "- Use cross-validation techniques such as k-folds cross-validation.\n",
    "- Use regularization techniques such as LASSO that penalize certain model parameters if they’re likely to cause overfitting.\n",
    "- example: a regression model that hits each sample data point. a decision tree that runs down to the find sample observation.\n",
    "- example: We frequently see newspaper reports about studies that overturn the previous findings, like eggs are no longer bad for your health, or saturated fat is not linked to heart disease. The problem, in our opinion is that many researchers, especially in social sciences or medicine, too frequently commit the cardinal sin of Data Mining - Overfitting the data.\n",
    "- The researchers test too many hypotheses without proper statistical control, until they happen to find something interesting and report it. Not surprisingly, next time the effect, which was (at least partly) due to chance, will be much smaller or absent.\n",
    "- identify: results are not repeatable. in-sample metrics are significantly different from out-of-sample metrics.\n",

    "#### 14. What is a spurious correlation?\n",
    "In statistics, a spurious correlation (or spuriousness) refers to a connection between two variables that appears to be causal but is not.\n",

    "#### 15. Give an example of how you would use experimental design to answer a question about user behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 1: Formulate the Research Question: What are the effects of page load times on user satisfaction ratings?\n",
    "- Step 2: Identify variables: We identify the cause & effect. Independent variable -page load time, Dependent variable- user satisfaction rating\n",
    "- Step 3: Generate Hypothesis: Lower page download time will have more effect on the user satisfaction rating for a web page. Here the factor we analyze is page load time.\n",
    "- Step 4: Determine Experimental Design. We consider experimental complexity i.e vary one factor at a time or multiple factors at one time in which case we use factorial design (2^k design). A design is also selected based on the type of objective (Comparative, Screening, Response surface) & number of factors. Here we also identify within-participants, between-participants, and mixed model.For e.g.: There are two versions of a page, one with Buy button (call to action) on left and the other version has this button on the right. Within-participants design - both user groups see both versions. Between-participants design - one group of users see version A & the other user group version B.\n",
    "- Step 5: Develop experimental task & procedure: Detailed description of steps involved in the experiment, tools used to measure user behavior, goals and success metrics should be defined. Collect qualitative data about user engagement to allow statistical analysis.\n",
    "- Step 6: Determine Manipulation & Measurements:\n",
    "- Manipulation: One level of factor will be controlled and the other will be manipulated.\n",
    "- Measures:\n",
    "- Latency- time between a prompt and occurrence of behavior (how long it takes for a user to click buy after being presented with products).\n",
    "- Frequency- number of times a behavior occurs (number of times the user clicks on a given page within a time)\n",
    "- Duration-length of time a specific behavior lasts(time taken to add all products)\n",
    "- Intensity-force with which a behavior occurs ( how quickly the user purchased a product)\n",
    "- Step 7: Analyze results: Identify user behavior data and support the hypothesis or contradict according to the observations made for e.g. how majority of users satisfaction ratings compared with page load times.\n",

    "Supervised machine learning algorithms use labeled observations, i.e. observations with a known outcome or human input, to develop a model that will then be used to predict or estimate the outcome of new observations which are not known or labeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised machine learning algorithms are considered self-learning as they not rely on labeled observations, i.e. observations with a known outcome or human input. Whereas the supervised algorithm would accept and use the labels assigned to it to model the relationship between the inputs (features) and output (target), an unsupervised algorithm would learn the differences of observations using only the features (no output) and assign its own labels to differentiate.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that is concerned with neural networks: how to use backpropagation and certain principles from neuroscience to more accurately model large sets of unlabelled or semi-structured data. In that sense deep learning represents an unsupervised learning algorithm that learns representations of data through the use of neural nets.\n",
