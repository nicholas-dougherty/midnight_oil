    "- Split the dataset into training and test sets\n",
    "- Use cross-validation techniques to further segment the dataset into composite sets of training and test sets within the data.\n",
    "- Implement a choice selection of performance metrics: here is a fairly comprehensive list. You could use measures such as the F1 score, the accuracy, and the confusion matrix.

    "\n",
    "- If you wanted to detect fraud in a massive dataset with a sample of millions, a more accurate model would most likely predict no fraud at all if only a vast minority of cases were fraud. However, this would be useless for a predictive model — a model designed to find fraud that asserted there was no fraud at all! Questions like this help you demonstrate that you understand model accuracy isn’t the be-all and end-all of model performance.\n",

    "***\n",
    "#### 10. What’s the F1 score? How would you use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is a measure of a model’s performance. It is a weighted average of the precision and recall of a model, with results tending to 1 being the best, and those tending to 0 being the worst. You would use it in classification tests where true negatives don’t matter much.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "#### 11. How would you handle an imbalanced dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "- An imbalanced dataset is when you have, for example, a classification test and 90% of the data is in one class. That leads to problems: an accuracy of 90% can be skewed if you have no predictive power on the other category of data! Here are a few tactics to get over the hump:\n",
    "     - 1- Collect more data to even the imbalances in the dataset.\n",
    "     - 2- Resample the dataset to correct for imbalances.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Overfitting is finding spurious results that are due to chance and cannot be reproduced by subsequent studies.\n",
    "- reduce risk of overfitting by:\n",
    "- Keep the model simpler: reduce variance by taking into account fewer variables and parameters, thereby removing some of the noise in the training data.\n",
    "- Use cross-validation techniques such as k-folds cross-validation.\n",
    "- Use regularization techniques such as LASSO that penalize certain model parameters if they’re likely to cause overfitting.\n",
    "- example: a regression model that hits each sample data point. a decision tree that runs down to the find sample observation.\n",
    "- example: We frequently see newspaper reports about studies that overturn the previous findings, like eggs are no longer bad for your health, or saturated fat is not linked to heart disease. The problem, in our opinion is that many researchers, especially in social sciences or medicine, too frequently commit the cardinal sin of Data Mining - Overfitting the data.\n",
    "- The researchers test too many hypotheses without proper statistical control, until they happen to find something interesting and report it. Not surprisingly, next time the effect, which was (at least partly) due to chance, will be much smaller or absent.\n",

    "- Step 2: Identify variables: We identify the cause & effect. Independent variable -page load time, Dependent variable- user satisfaction rating\n",
    "- Step 3: Generate Hypothesis: Lower page download time will have more effect on the user satisfaction rating for a web page. Here the factor we analyze is page load time.\n",
    "- Step 4: Determine Experimental Design. We consider experimental complexity i.e vary one factor at a time or multiple factors at one time in which case we use factorial design (2^k design). A design is also selected based on the type of objective (Comparative, Screening, Response surface) & number of factors. Here we also identify within-participants, between-participants, and mixed model.For e.g.: There are two versions of a page, one with Buy button (call to action) on left and the other version has this button on the right. Within-participants design - both user groups see both versions. Between-participants design - one group of users see version A & the other user group version B.\n",
    "- Step 5: Develop experimental task & procedure: Detailed description of steps involved in the experiment, tools used to measure user behavior, goals and success metrics should be defined. Collect qualitative data about user engagement to allow statistical analysis.\n",
    "- Step 6: Determine Manipulation & Measurements:\n",
    "- Manipulation: One level of factor will be controlled and the other will be manipulated.\n",
    "- Measures:\n",
    "- Latency- time between a prompt and occurrence of behavior (how long it takes for a user to click buy after being presented with products).\n",
    "- Frequency- number of times a behavior occurs (number of times the user clicks on a given page within a time)\n",
    "- Duration-length of time a specific behavior lasts(time taken to add all products)\n",
    "- Intensity-force with which a behavior occurs ( how quickly the user purchased a product)\n",
    "- Step 7: Analyze results: Identify user behavior data and support the hypothesis or contradict according to the observations made for e.g. how majority of users satisfaction ratings compared with page load times.\n",

    "- Bayes’ Theorem gives you the posterior probability of an event given what is known as prior knowledge.\n",
    "- Mathematically, it’s expressed as the true positive rate of a condition sample divided by the sum of the false positive rate of the population and the true positive rate of a condition.\n",

Would you actually have a 60% chance of having the flu after having a positive test?\n",
    "- Bayes’ Theorem says no. It says that you have a (.6 * 0.05) (True Positive Rate of a Condition Sample) / (.60.05)(True Positive Rate of a Condition Sample) + (.50.95) (False Positive Rate of a Population) = 0.0594 or 5.94% chance of getting a flu.\n",

    "- It depends on the question as well as on the domain for which we are trying to solve the question.\n",
    "- In medical testing, false negatives may provide a falsely reassuring message to patients and physicians that disease is absent, when it is actually present. This sometimes leads to inappropriate or inadequate treatment of both the patient and their disease. So, it is desired to have too many false positive.\n",
    "- For spam filtering, a false positive occurs when spam filtering or spam blocking techniques wrongly classify a legitimate email message as spam and, as a result, interferes with its delivery. While most anti-spam tactics can block or filter a high percentage of unwanted emails, doing so without creating significant false-positive results is a much more demanding task. So, we prefer too many false negatives over many false positives.\n",

    "- Here is a comparison of these 2 approaches used in two popular music recommender systems - Last.fm and Pandora Radio. (example from Recommender System entry)\n",
    "  - Last.fm creates a \"station\" of recommended songs by observing what bands and individual tracks the user has listened to on a regular basis and comparing those against the listening behavior of other users. Last.fm will play tracks that do not appear in the user's library, but are often played by other users with similar interests. As this approach leverages the behavior of users, it is an example of a collaborative filtering technique.\n",
    "  - Pandora uses the properties of a song or artist (a subset of the 400 attributes provided by the Music Genome Project) in order to seed a \"station\" that plays music with similar properties. User feedback is used to refine the station's results, deemphasizing certain attributes when a user \"dislikes\" a particular song and emphasizing other attributes when a user \"likes\" a song.
