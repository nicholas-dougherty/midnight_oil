In keeping with an essential principle of software development, _Don't repeat yourself_, \"every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.\" One specific application of this principle is through the use of ITERATION that involves going over a list of items. One of the most basic forms of this is through a __for loop__.      \n",

Objects like lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, strings, et cetera, are called iterables. Each of these can be looped through/over. Think of an iterable as a container that has data or values, this container is explored through iteration to get elements. The ITERATOR is an object representing a stream of data that produces a data values at a time using the next() method. In Python, an iterator is an object which implements the iterator protocol, which means it consists of the methods such as  __iter__() and __next__().     \n",
